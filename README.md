<h3 align="center">Who am I?</h3>

- üí¨ I am a Full Stack developer specializing in the backend, passionate about building modern, scalable, and well-organized applications. My background as a mechanical engineer taught me to solve complex problems with logic and precision, skills that are now applied to software development.

<h3 align="center">What do I do?</h3>

Although my main focus is on the backend, I also have experience working with frontend technologies such as React, Redux, and React Context. This allows me to approach projects holistically and collaborate as a Full Stack developer when needed.
